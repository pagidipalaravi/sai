Ordered HTML List - The Type Attribute

HTML Block and Inline Elements
    Every HTML element has a default display value, depending on what type of element it is.
    There are two display values: block and inline. 
Block-level Elements
  A block-level element always starts on a new line.
  A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).
  A block level element has a top and a bottom margin, whereas an inline element does not
   The <div> element is a block-level element
Inline Elements
   An inline element does not start on a new line.
  An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.
  This is a <span> element inside a paragraph.  
The <div> Element
   The <div> element is often used as a container for other HTML elements.
   The <div> element has no required attributes, but style, class and id are common.
   When used together with CSS, the <div> element can be used to style blocks of content  
The <span> Element
   The <span> element is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document.
   The <span> element has no required attributes, but style, class and id are common.
   When used together with CSS, the <span> element can be used to style parts of the text  
HTML class Attribute
  The HTML class attribute is used to specify a class for an HTML element.
  Multiple HTML elements can share the same class
Using The class Attribute
  The class attribute is often used to point to a class name in a style sheet. It can also be used by a JavaScript to access and manipulate elements with the specific class name.
  In the following example we have three <div> elements with a class attribute with the value of "city". 
  All of the three <div> elements will be styled equally according to the 
  .city style definition in the head section:
The Syntax For Class
  To create a class; write a period (.) character, followed by a class name. Then, define the CSS properties within curly braces {}:  
Multiple Classes
HTML elements can belong to more than one class.
  To define multiple classes, separate the class names with a space, e.g. <div class="city main">.
  The element will be styled according to all the classes specified.
  In the following example, the first <h2> element belongs to both the city class and also to the main class,
  and will get the CSS styles from both of the classes  
Different Elements Can Share Same Class
  Different HTML elements can point to the same class name.
  In the following example, both <h2> and <p> points to the "city" class and will share the same style:
Use of The class Attribute in JavaScript
  The class name can also be used by JavaScript to perform certain tasks for specific elements.
  JavaScript can access elements with a specific class name with the getElementsByClassName() method:
