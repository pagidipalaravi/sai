HTML Images
  Images can improve the design and the appearance of a web page.

HTML Images Syntax
  The HTML <img> tag is used to embed an image in a web page.
  Images are not technically inserted into a web page; images are linked to web pages. The <img> tag creates a holding space for the referenced image.
  The <img> tag is empty, it contains attributes only, and does not have a closing tag.
  The <img> tag has two required attributes:

src - Specifies the path to the image
alt - Specifies an alternate text for the image
    <img src="url" alt="alternatetext">
The src Attribute
   The required src attribute specifies the path (URL) to the image.
   <img src="img_chania.jpg" alt="Flowers in Chania">
The alt Attribute
  The required alt attribute provides an alternate text for an image, if the user for some reason cannot view it (because of slow connection, 
  an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader).
  The value of the alt attribute should describe the image   
   <img src="img_chania.jpg" alt="Flowers in Chania">
Image Size - Width and Height
   You can use the style attribute to specify the width and height of an image   
    <img src="img_girl.jpg" alt="Girl in a jacket" style="width:500px;height:600px;">
Width and Height, or Style?
 The width, height, and style attributes are all valid in HTML.
 However, we suggest using the style attribute. It prevents styles sheets from changing the size of images:	
Images in Another Folder
   If you have your images in a sub-folder, you must include the folder name in the src attribute: 
Images on Another Server/Website
  Some web sites point to an image on another server.
  To point to an image on another server, you must specify an absolute (full) URL in the src attribute:  
Animated Images
  HTML allows animated GIFs  
  <img src="programming.gif" alt="Computer Man" style="width:48px;height:48px;">
Image as a Link
  To use an image as a link, put the <img> tag inside the <a> tag
Image Floating
   Use the CSS float property to let the image float to the right or to the left of a text:	
   
Image Maps
  The HTML <map> tag defines an image map. An image map is an image with clickable areas. The areas are defined with one or more <area> tags.
  Try to click on the computer, phone, or the cup of coffee in the image below:   
The Image
  The image is inserted using the <img> tag. The only difference from other images is that you must add a usemap attribute: 
  <img src="workplace.jpg" alt="Workplace" usemap="#workmap">
Create Image Map
  Then, add a <map> element.
  The <map> element is used to create an image map, and is linked to the image by using the required name attribute: 
  <map name="workmap">
The Areas
  Then, add the clickable areas.
  A clickable area is defined using an <area> element.
Shape
  You must define the shape of the clickable area, and you can choose one of these values:
rect - defines a rectangular region
circle - defines a circular region
poly - defines a polygonal region
default - defines the entire region 
Shape="rect"
  The coordinates for shape="rect" come in pairs, one for the x-axis and one for the y-axis.
  So, the coordinates 34,44 is located 34 pixels from the left margin and 44 pixels from the top:
  The coordinates 270,350 is located 270 pixels from the left margin and 350 pixels from the top:

Shape="circle"
 To add a circle area, first locate the coordinates of the center of the circle:

337,300
Then specify the radius of the circle:
 44 pixels
Shape="poly"
 The shape="poly" contains several coordinate points, which creates a shape formed with straight lines (a polygon).
 This can be used to create any shape.
 Like maybe a croissant shape!
 How can we make the croissant in the image below become a clickable link? 
 
Background Image on a HTML element
  To add a background image on an HTML element, use the HTML style attribute and the CSS background-image property: 
Background Image on a Page
  If you want the entire page to have a background image, you must specify the background image on the <body> element:
Background Repeat
  If the background image is smaller than the element, the image will repeat itself, horizontally and vertically, until it reaches the end of the element:
Background Cover
  If you want the background image to cover the entire element, you can set the background-size property to cover.
  Also, to make sure the entire element is always covered, set the background-attachment property to fixed:
  This way, the background image will cover the entire element, with no stretching (the image will keep its original proportions):
Background Stretch
  If you want the background image to stretch to fit the entire element, you can set the background-size property to 100% 100%:
  
HTML <picture> Element
  The HTML <picture> element allows you to display different pictures for different devices or screen sizes.

The HTML <picture> Element
   The HTML <picture> element gives web developers more flexibility in specifying image resources.
   The <picture> element contains one or more <source> elements, each referring to different images through the srcset attribute. 
   This way the browser can choose the image that best fits the current view and/or device.
   Each <source> element has a media attribute that defines when the image is the most suitable
When to use the Picture Element
   There are two main purposes for the <picture> element:

     1. Bandwidth
      If you have a small screen or device, it is not necessary to load a large image file. The browser will use the first <source> element with matching attribute values,
       and ignore any of the following elements.

     2. Format Support
      Some browsers or devices may not support all image formats. By using the <picture> element, you can add images of all formats,
      and the browser will use the first format it recognizes, and ignore any of the following elements.
