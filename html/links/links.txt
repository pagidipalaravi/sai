HTML Links - Hyperlinks
   HTML links are hyperlinks.

HTML Links - Syntax

    An unvisited link is underlined and blue
    A visited link is underlined and purple
    An active link is underlined and red
	
HTML Links - The target Attribute
  By default, the linked page will be displayed in the current browser window. To change this, you must specify another target for the link.
  The target attribute specifies where to open the linked document.
  The target attribute can have one of the following values:

  _self - Default. Opens the document in the same window/tab as it was clicked
  _blank - Opens the document in a new window or tab
  _parent - Opens the document in the parent frame
  _top - Opens the document in the full body of the window

   Both examples above are using an absolute URL (a full web address) in the href attribute.
   A local link (a link to a page within the same website) is specified with a relative URL (without the "https://www" part):

Button as a Link
  To use an HTML button as a link, you have to add some JavaScript code.

Link Titles
  The title attribute specifies extra information about an element. The information is most often shown as a tooltip text when the mouse moves over the element 
Link Buttons
  A link can also be styled as a button, by using CSS
Create a Bookmark in HTML
  Bookmarks can be useful if a web page is very long.
  To create a bookmark - first create the bookmark, then add a link to it.
  When the link is clicked, the page will scroll down or up to the location with the bookmark
