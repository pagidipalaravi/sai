Three Ways to Insert CSS
There are three ways of inserting a style sheet:

  External CSS
  Internal CSS
  Inline CSS
External CSS
  With an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!
  Each HTML page must include a reference to the external style sheet file inside the <link> element, inside the head section.  
Internal CSS
  An internal style sheet may be used if one single HTML page has a unique style.
  The internal style is defined inside the <style> element, inside the head section. 
Inline CSS
  An inline style may be used to apply a unique style for a single element.
  To use inline styles, add the style attribute to the relevant element. The style attribute can contain any CSS property.
